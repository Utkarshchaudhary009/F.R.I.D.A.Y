धूल का तुषार (Dust of Snow) - हिंदी सारांश:रॉबर्ट फ्रॉस्ट की कविता "धूल का तुषार" में कवि एक साधारण लेकिन महत्वपूर्ण घटना का वर्णन करता है। एक दिन, कवि का मूड खराब होता है और वह उदासी से घिरा होता है। उसी समय, एक कौआ एक हिमाच्छादित वृक्ष की शाखा पर बैठता है और उसके ऊपर बर्फ की धूल गिरा देता है। यह छोटी सी घटना कवि के मूड को बदल देती है और उसका दिन बेहतर हो जाता है। कविता यह संदेश देती है कि कभी-कभी छोटी-छोटी घटनाएं भी हमारे जीवन में बड़ी सकारात्मकता ला सकती हैं। अग्नि और बर्फ (Fire and Ice) - हिंदी सारांश:रॉबर्ट फ्रॉस्ट की कविता "अग्नि और बर्फ" मानवता के अंत के दो संभावित तरीकों पर विचार करती है। कवि के अनुसार, कुछ लोग मानते हैं कि दुनिया आग (अग्नि) में समाप्त हो जाएगी, जो इच्छा और लालसा का प्रतीक है। वहीं, कुछ लोग सोचते हैं कि यह बर्फ (बर्फ) में समाप्त हो जाएगी, जो घृणा और उदासीनता का प्रतीक है। कवि व्यक्तिगत रूप से दोनों को विनाशकारी मानता है, लेकिन वह कहता है कि अगर उसे एक को चुनना हो, तो वह आग को चुनेगा। हालांकि, वह यह भी मानता है कि बर्फ भी दुनिया को नष्ट करने के लिए पर्याप्त है। Dust of Snow - English Summary:In Robert Frost's poem "Dust of Snow," the poet describes a simple yet significant event.

Here is a detailed summary:Summary:Tricki, a small and overly indulged dog, is the beloved pet of Mrs. Pumphrey. Mrs. Pumphrey showers Tricki with excessive affection, food, and treats, leading to his obesity and health problems. Tricki becomes lethargic, overweight, and unable to move properly due to his unhealthy lifestyle.Seeing Tricki's deteriorating condition, Mrs. Pumphrey becomes extremely worried and calls upon Mr. Herriot, a veterinary surgeon, for help. Mr. Herriot is appalled by Tricki's state and advises Mrs. Pumphrey to put him on a strict diet and exercise regimen. However, Mrs. Pumphrey, unable to control her affection, continues to pamper Tricki.Realizing that Mrs. Pumphrey is not following his advice, Mr. Herriot decides to take Tricki to his veterinary hospital for a few days. At the hospital, Tricki is put on a strict diet and given regular exercise. Initially, Tricki is listless and unresponsive, but gradually he begins to show signs of improvement. He starts to play and interact with the other dogs at the hospital, regains his energy, and loses weight.Within a fortnight, Tricki is back to his normal, healthy self. Mr. Herriot informs Mrs. Pumphrey about Tricki's recovery, and she is overjoyed. She believes that it is nothing short of a triumph of surgery and is immensely grateful to Mr. Herriot. When Tricki returns home, Mrs. Pumphrey showers Mr. Herriot with gifts and praises for saving her beloved pet.The story ends on a humorous note, highlighting the contrast between Mrs. Pumphrey's indulgent care and the simple, disciplined regimen that actually restored Tricki's health.
